This lua configuration is heavily inspired by [lesvim](https://github.com/MiaadTeam/lesvim) and also [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)


# Setup

This directory should be a directory in `~/.config/` (Linux), `~/AppData/Local/` [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/hd8heg/neovim_initvim_config_file_location_on_windows/)

### The after directory runs after init and all others have been run.. 

Packages are searched after in the following places: 
Linux
> ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
Windows
> "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim-data\site\pack\packer\start\packer.nvim"
